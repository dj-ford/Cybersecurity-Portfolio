# Incident Report Analysis: Network DDoS Event

## Summary
The company experienced a significant security event when network services stopped responding. Investigation revealed the disruption was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack using a flood of ICMP packets. The cybersecurity team quickly mitigated the attack by blocking the malicious traffic and temporarily suspending non-critical services, allowing critical network systems to be restored.

## Identify
The attack targeted the company’s entire internal network, affecting all critical resources. The cybersecurity team identified the threat as a coordinated ICMP flood designed to overwhelm network infrastructure. Immediate assessment focused on determining which assets and services were impacted and prioritizing their protection.

## Protect
To reduce future risk, the team implemented a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets. Additionally, an IDS/IPS system was configured to filter suspicious ICMP traffic, helping prevent similar attacks from disrupting the network.

## Detect
Source IP verification was enabled on the firewall to identify and block spoofed IP addresses. Network monitoring tools were also deployed to detect abnormal traffic patterns, enabling faster detection of potential security incidents.

## Respond
The team established procedures to isolate affected systems during an attack to limit network disruption. Critical systems and services are restored first, followed by a detailed analysis of network logs to identify suspicious activity. All incidents are documented and reported to management and, when necessary, legal authorities.

## Recover
Recovery procedures focus on returning all network services to normal operations. Non-critical services are initially suspended to reduce load during attacks, while critical services are restored first. Once the attack subsides, non-critical systems are gradually brought back online, ensuring overall network stability and continuity.

## Reflections / Notes
This incident highlights the importance of layered defenses, including firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, and network monitoring. Regular testing and updates to security configurations are critical to prevent similar DDoS attacks. Additionally, clear response procedures ensure rapid restoration of services and minimize operational disruption.
