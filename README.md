# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of my hands-on cybersecurity work, created primarily through the **Google Foundations of Cybersecurity** course on Coursera and expanded with additional projects, labs, and practical exercises. Its purpose is to demonstrate my technical skills, document my learning process, and provide clear evidence of my ability to apply cybersecurity concepts in real-world scenarios.

##  Purpose of This Portfolio

The goal of this repository is to:

- **Showcase practical cybersecurity skills** through documented work, screenshots, configurations, packet captures, and written analysis.
- **Demonstrate my understanding of security fundamentals** — including threat analysis, risk management, networking basics, incident response, and security best practices.
- **Provide employers and collaborators with transparent, reproducible evidence** of my progress and capabilities.


Rather than simply listing certificates, this portfolio emphasizes **real artifacts, real analysis, and real hands-on experience**.

Each item includes:
- A write-up explaining **what I did**, **why it matters**, and **what I learned**  
- Supporting evidence: screenshots, packet captures, exported configurations, diagrams

##  What This Portfolio Demonstrates

Through this portfolio, I aim to highlight skills such as:

- Identifying common security threats and vulnerabilities  
- Analyzing phishing attempts and social engineering tactics  
- Understanding and inspecting network traffic  
- Using cybersecurity tools (e.g., Wireshark, virtual machines, command-line utilities)  
- Documenting processes clearly and professionally  
- Applying foundational security principles to realistic scenarios  

Each completed item is written to be **clear, concise, and technically accurate**, making it easy for hiring managers, instructors, or peers to understand what I accomplished.

## Final Note

This portfolio is an evolving record of my development as a cybersecurity professional.  
It reflects my commitment to continuous learning, clear documentation, and real hands-on practice.

As I progress through more courses and build additional projects, this repository will continue to expand, showcasing both what I’ve learned and the practical ways I’ve applied that knowledge.
